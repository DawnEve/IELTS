<p>Finally, long-term innovation happens because U.S. companies participate in markets all over the world. A senior U.S. semiconductor-company executive told me recently that U.S. companies’ sales to and investments in China give them access to Chinese efforts on cloud computing, AI, and autonomy, and thus make U.S. products much better at responding to a changing world market. //美国企业长期创新的原因。</p>

Bill Gates Wants to Change That</a></h2>
			<p>
<p>But that hasn’t been the case with Alzheimer’s disease, the neurodegenerative condition that was first described in 1906, and more than a century later, still doesn’t have a blood test or brain scan that can diagnose it conclusively. </p>
<p>Now Bill Gates, who decided to invest $100 million in Alzheimer’s disease research in 2017 and revealed earlier this year that his father was affected by the disease, is now directing some of that commitment to developing a diagnostic test. //指引他的部分投入去开发一个诊断检测。</p>
<p>The project will solicit and then fund the most promising ideas for developing a test for Alzheimer’s, whether that be in the form of a blood test, a retinal eye scan, a urine or saliva test or even some other innovative way of detecting the signs of the disease.</p>
<p>He points out that having a diagnostic test for Alzheimer’s would not only identify people earlier in the disease process, and make it possible for them to participate in promising clinical trials of treatments, but also help existing studies of encouraging therapies by providing a way for doctors to track the progression of the disease and how effective the experimental treatment might be.</p>
<p>“I think that having a diagnostic test for Alzheimer’s is going to have tremendous implications for accelerating the development of new drugs,” says Fillit.</p>

			<p>
<p>Today marks the 165th anniversary of the birth of Vincent van Gogh (1853-90), one of the world’s most popular and distinctive painters.</p>
<p>He spent time in a number of psychiatric institutions, notably at Saint-Remy where he painted his fellow inmates, before finally losing faith in the hope that he might ever be cured of the madness and despair that hounded him and taking his own life. //notably 用于举例子

adv.显著地；非常地；引人注目地； 

notably/remarkably/dramatically/considerably/prominently/markedly/ </p>
<p>Taken together, the letters illuminate Van Gogh’s working life, motivations and personality to a degree no biography could hope to approach.</p>
<p>For all the striking chrome yellows and cobalt blues, the sunshine and warmth that backlight his compositions, darkness is rarely far away. //rarely 表示否定 </p>
<p>The Starry Night depicts the view from his hospital room, a cold fact that jars with the fantastic, dreamlike vision he conjures. //jar 不和谐，不相配</p>
<p>Theo may never have realised his dream of opening a gallery of his own, but his invaluable contribution ensured his brother’s tragic life was not in vain. A statue of the two brothers by Russian sculptor Ossip Zadkine today stands in their hometown of Zundert, celebrating their special bond. </p>
<p>These days Vincent van Gogh is a one-man culture industry, remarkable considering that he sold only one painting in his lifetime, The Red Vineyard (1888), and that to a friend’s sister.</p>
<p>Art historian Lucrezia Walker points out that London’s National Gallery, which paid £1,300 for Sunflowers in 1924, sells countless items of Van Gogh merchandise in its gift shop and has made more than £2m from the sale of postcards of that painting alone. </p>
<p>Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum meanwhile sees tourists queueing around the block on a daily basis. Its director, Axel Ruger, attributes the enduring nature of its subject’s appeal to “the romance of the unrealised promise”.</p>
<p>Last year’s film Loving Vincent, told his story in the world’s first animated feature to be entirely hand-painted in oils, an extraordinary labour of love worthy of the man himself.</p>

			<p>			
<p>A STRAIGHT TRACK through a wood, and a guard hut at the end of it, is all there is to “China City of America”.  //为什么是is? a, and b, is ...[病句]</p>

<p>Canada had a similar scheme, but scrapped it in 2014 after it became heavily oversubscribed by wealthy Chinese. //scrap 废弃</p>

<p>长难句： The American one has come under growing scrutiny since it emerged that Nicole Meyer, the sister of President Donald Trump’s influential son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had touted her connections with the Trump family when trying to attract investors to an EB-5 project during a trip to China last May.</p>

<p>In 2017 more than 46% of Chinese with fortunes between 10m and 200m yuan ($1.3m-26.3m) were thinking of emigrating, according to a survey by Hurun, the research company in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The insecurity of wealthy Chinese, and their craving for Western education for their children, is evident in the rapid growth of whole communities of them in the suburbs of big Australian, American and Canadian cities. // a, and b, is ...主谓一致?[病句]</p>

<p>Such places also point to a contradiction in the story of China’s own development. Despite more opportunities at home, growing numbers of those who can afford it seem to want to leave. Even China’s state-owned media admit this. </p>

<p>The number of Chinese students in Australia increased by 17% last year, to 140,000. Apart from the quality of the education, and less fierce competition for places than at China’s best universities, there is another powerful draw: the relative ease with which foreigners who have graduated in Australia can become resident there.// with which是什么从句？with可以替换为其他介词吗？</p>

<p>In Sydney, Monika Tu, the founder of Black Diamondz Property Concierge, specialises in selling expensive houses to rich Chinese. She says she sees little impact from China’s recent clampdown on the movement of capital abroad, or from the government’s efforts to stop corrupt officials from fleeing the country with their wealth. Growing numbers of her clients are young Chinese who have made their fortunes in the country’s booming tech industries.</p>


<p>Many poorer Chinese, too, are attracted by life abroad. The country’s economy may be booming, but for people from rural China, settling and prospering in a big Chinese city can often be as hard as going to work in a foreign country, sometimes even harder. <br />Internal migrants in China are often treated as second-class citizens. Too tough in Ningbo? Try Namibia.</p>
