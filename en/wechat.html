			<p>			
<p>A STRAIGHT TRACK through a wood, and a guard hut at the end of it, is all there is to “China City of America”.  //为什么是is? a, and b, is ...[病句]</p>

<p>Canada had a similar scheme, but scrapped it in 2014 after it became heavily oversubscribed by wealthy Chinese. //scrap 废弃</p>

<p>长难句： The American one has come under growing scrutiny since it emerged that Nicole Meyer, the sister of President Donald Trump’s influential son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had touted her connections with the Trump family when trying to attract investors to an EB-5 project during a trip to China last May.</p>

<p>In 2017 more than 46% of Chinese with fortunes between 10m and 200m yuan ($1.3m-26.3m) were thinking of emigrating, according to a survey by Hurun, the research company in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The insecurity of wealthy Chinese, and their craving for Western education for their children, is evident in the rapid growth of whole communities of them in the suburbs of big Australian, American and Canadian cities. // a, and b, is ...主谓一致?[病句]</p>

<p>Such places also point to a contradiction in the story of China’s own development. Despite more opportunities at home, growing numbers of those who can afford it seem to want to leave. Even China’s state-owned media admit this. </p>

<p>The number of Chinese students in Australia increased by 17% last year, to 140,000. Apart from the quality of the education, and less fierce competition for places than at China’s best universities, there is another powerful draw: the relative ease with which foreigners who have graduated in Australia can become resident there.// with which是什么从句？with可以替换为其他介词吗？</p>

<p>In Sydney, Monika Tu, the founder of Black Diamondz Property Concierge, specialises in selling expensive houses to rich Chinese. She says she sees little impact from China’s recent clampdown on the movement of capital abroad, or from the government’s efforts to stop corrupt officials from fleeing the country with their wealth. Growing numbers of her clients are young Chinese who have made their fortunes in the country’s booming tech industries.</p>


<p>Many poorer Chinese, too, are attracted by life abroad. The country’s economy may be booming, but for people from rural China, settling and prospering in a big Chinese city can often be as hard as going to work in a foreign country, sometimes even harder. <br />Internal migrants in China are often treated as second-class citizens. Too tough in Ningbo? Try Namibia.</p>

			<p>
<p>The U.S. and its allies need to push back calmly but firmly against activities that jeopardize not only the safety of their personnel, but peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific—and America’s longer-term strategic position. //主语换成China也挺顺溜。</p>

<p>The common component in all these meetings is the absence of the United States, which may explain the excellent progress that has been seen.</p>
