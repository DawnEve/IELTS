			<p>
<p>The coming of spring, for medieval poets, usually means the chance of something exciting happening. //插入语</p>
<p>Once flowers, birdsong and sunshine tempt a poet to roam outdoors, spring may be the time for encounters with fairies, lovers and all kinds of marvellous adventures. //once引导的状语从句，引导时间或条件根据句意决定，翻译成:一...就...;一旦....; 当..的什么.</p>
<p>The 13th-century poem The Owl and the Nightingale begins in just such a way, with the poet in a pastoral valley full of blossom. //with结构</p>
<p>If this beautifully silly poem has any serious lesson to teach, it is probably that: a warning against allowing an argumentative spirit to make a fool of you.//教训 lesson to teach; spirit  (具有某种特质或热情的) 人; </p>

			<p>
<p>Last autumn, US silos and grain elevators brimmed with a bumper crop of soybeans, yet soy farmers were decidedly not brimming with joy. //[生词生意]elevator 粮仓 //brim vi. 满溢；溢出 //</p>
<p>There just wasn’t enough room. Some farmers had no choice but to pile their beans on the ground, at the mercy of nature, or give up and plough them under to rot.//看老天心情</p>
<p>America’s soybean exporters, processors and some 300,000 farmers are seeing their previously $41 billion industry suffer, perhaps irreversibly. //seeing 眼睁睁的看着 </p>
<p>The expansion of railways made marketing wheat to Europe more cost-effective. //修路的好处 </p>
<p>Eventually much of that prairie became covered in rotations of maize and soybeans, as the yields, uses and prices of those crops increased. </p>
<p>The soy export ban was only fully in effect for seven days. Yet the spooked Japanese decided they could no longer rely on the US as their sole supplier and invested heavily, for 21 years, in turning Brazil into a soy titan. //美国曾禁止大豆出口日本。多元依赖才是正道。</p>
<p>Argentina and Paraguay, seeing the huge profitability of Brazilian soy, followed suit. //紧随其后</p>
<p>Even brief interruptions to previously successful trading relationships can convince an importer that its trading partner is no longer reliable. Buyers and investors turn elsewhere. //即使一次短时间的打断，也会... </p>
<p>The fewer the planet’s trees, the greater the likelihood of flooding, wildfires, extreme weather and infectious diseases. //The fewer ..., the greater ...</p>
<p>Nixon’s 1973 blunder demonstrates that the abrupt disruption of trade relations can signal unreliability to commercial partners, with long-term environmental consequences. //with结构</p>
<p>If history provides any guide, the current disruption of the soybean trade between the US and China should concern us all.</p>

			<p>
<p>The question Uniqlo faces now is whether it can inherit the Gap’s empire without repeating its mistakes.//with or without doing ...</p>
<p>Uniqlo has profited from changes in American society, some of which might seem at first glance to be unrelated to fashion. </p>
<p>Millennial shoppers entered a job market with fewer jobs, while carrying more student debt, which limited how much money many of them could spend on clothes. 
</p>
<p>That austerity contributed to a cultural shift, in which conspicuously expensive clothing fell out of favor.//非限制性定语从句</p>
<p>Until the end of the 19th century, when Western influence became more prevalent, kimonos were commonly worn by Japanese people of varying ages and classes. </p>
<p>Uniqlo can’t promise anything approaching that longevity, but in an era of disposable fashion, a Uniqlo garment, made from hearty materials and cut in a timeless style, can feel like an investment piece. </p>

			<p>
<p>A new study concludes there’s no amount of alcohol consumption that’s safe for overall health — a finding that’s likely to surprise moderate drinkers, and that has left some experts unconvinced.</p>
<p>But the new paper, published Thursday in The Lancet, calls that long-held conclusion into question.</p>
<p>The new research was based on a review of nearly 700 existing studies on global drinking prevalence and nearly 600 studies on alcohol and health, and found that alcohol was the seventh leading risk factor for premature death in 2016, contributing to 2.8 million deaths worldwide. //酒精是2016第七大早死因素，导致全世界280万死亡。</p>

			<p>
<p>New research shows that curiosity is vital to an organization’s performance—as are the particular ways in which people are curious and the experiences they are exposed to. // 列举句型 A is vital to sth-as are B and C.</p>
<p>This package examines how leaders can nurture curiosity throughout their organizations and ensure that it translates to success.</p>
<p>That’s because cultivating it at all levels helps leaders and their employees adapt to uncertain market conditions and external pressures: When our curiosity is triggered, we think more deeply and rationally about decisions and come up with more-creative solutions. //好奇的好处：适应不确定的市场环境和外界压力、理性决策、创新解决方案</p>
<p>My research found that curiosity encourages members of a group to put themselves in one another’s shoes and take an interest in one another’s ideas rather than focus only on their own perspective. //put themselves in one another’s shoes设身处地的为别人着想</p>
<p>In the survey of more than 3,000 employees mentioned earlier, 92% credited curious people with bringing new ideas into teams and organizations and viewed curiosity as a catalyst for job satisfaction, motivation, innovation, and high performance. //credit sb with (doing) sth 相信sb有某优点[做了某件好事]</p>
<p>But in the late 1920s, as the U.S. economy rose to new heights, consumers started wanting greater variety in their cars. While Ford remained fixated on improving the Model T, competitors such as General Motors started producing an array of models and soon captured the main share of the market. Owing to its single-minded focus on efficiency, Ford stopped experimenting and innovating and fell behind. //1.经济增长到新高 2.抓住主要的市场份额 3.owing to 引导原因</p>
<p>Although initial levels of curiosity varied, after six months everyone’s curiosity had dropped, with the average decline exceeding 20%. //with独立主格结构，跟名词或者非谓语动词</p>
<p>It takes thought and discipline to stop stifling curiosity and start fostering it. //抑制 培养</p>

			<p>
<p>Current U.N. Secretary General António Guterres called Mr. Annan “a guiding force for good,” and added: “He provided people everywhere with a space for dialogue, a place for problem-solving and a path to a better world.” //如何评价一个公众人物人？</p>
<p>He did not fit the stereotype of the haughty and secretive international civil servant. //符合...的刻板印象</p>
<p>In 1995, Mr. Annan oversaw the transfer of U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia to a NATO-led force after years of devastating ethnically driven conflict. Mr. Annan’s comments at the time reflected the anguish felt by many at the United Nations over being unable to end that war. // over用的好</p>
<p>“In looking back we shall all record how we responded to the escalating horrors of the last four years,” he said. “And as we do so, there are questions that each of us will have to answer. What did I do? Could I have done more? And could it have made a difference? Did I let my prejudice, my indifference and my fear overwhelm my reason? And how would I react next time?” //安南的反思</p>
<p>For that reason, Mr. Annan had a bruising second term as he pushed back against President George W. Bush’s growing determination to invade Iraq for supposedly harboring weapons of mass destruction. //表示不确定性supposedly, It appeared ...</p>
<p>Mr. Annan became a continual irritant to the Americans. He eliminated an easy excuse for war by persuading the Iraqis to allow U.N. inspectors back in to search for weapons of mass destruction. //大规模杀伤性武器</p>

<p>Finally, long-term innovation happens because U.S. companies participate in markets all over the world.

Bill Gates Wants to Change That</a></h2>
			<p>
<p>But that hasn’t been the case with Alzheimer’s disease, the neurodegenerative condition that was first described in 1906, and more than a century later, still doesn’t have a blood test or brain scan that can diagnose it conclusively. </p>
<p>Now Bill Gates, who decided to invest $100 million in Alzheimer’s disease research in 2017 and revealed earlier this year that his father was affected by the disease, is now directing some of that commitment to developing a diagnostic test. //指引他的部分投入去开发一个诊断检测。</p>
<p>The project will solicit and then fund the most promising ideas for developing a test for Alzheimer’s, whether that be in the form of a blood test, a retinal eye scan, a urine or saliva test or even some other innovative way of detecting the signs of the disease.</p>
<p>He points out that having a diagnostic test for Alzheimer’s would not only identify people earlier in the disease process, and make it possible for them to participate in promising clinical trials of treatments, but also help existing studies of encouraging therapies by providing a way for doctors to track the progression of the disease and how effective the experimental treatment might be.</p>
<p>“I think that having a diagnostic test for Alzheimer’s is going to have tremendous implications for accelerating the development of new drugs,” says Fillit.</p>

			<p>
<p>Today marks the 165th anniversary of the birth of Vincent van Gogh (1853-90), one of the world’s most popular and distinctive painters.</p>
<p>He spent time in a number of psychiatric institutions, notably at Saint-Remy where he painted his fellow inmates, before finally losing faith in the hope that he might ever be cured of the madness and despair that hounded him and taking his own life. //notably 用于举例子

adv.显著地；非常地；引人注目地； 

notably/remarkably/dramatically/considerably/prominently/markedly/ </p>
<p>Taken together, the letters illuminate Van Gogh’s working life, motivations and personality to a degree no biography could hope to approach.</p>
<p>For all the striking chrome yellows and cobalt blues, the sunshine and warmth that backlight his compositions, darkness is rarely far away. //rarely 表示否定 </p>
<p>The Starry Night depicts the view from his hospital room, a cold fact that jars with the fantastic, dreamlike vision he conjures. //jar 不和谐，不相配</p>
<p>Theo may never have realised his dream of opening a gallery of his own, but his invaluable contribution ensured his brother’s tragic life was not in vain. A statue of the two brothers by Russian sculptor Ossip Zadkine today stands in their hometown of Zundert, celebrating their special bond. </p>
<p>These days Vincent van Gogh is a one-man culture industry, remarkable considering that he sold only one painting in his lifetime, The Red Vineyard (1888), and that to a friend’s sister.</p>
<p>Art historian Lucrezia Walker points out that London’s National Gallery, which paid £1,300 for Sunflowers in 1924, sells countless items of Van Gogh merchandise in its gift shop and has made more than £2m from the sale of postcards of that painting alone. </p>
<p>Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum meanwhile sees tourists queueing around the block on a daily basis. Its director, Axel Ruger, attributes the enduring nature of its subject’s appeal to “the romance of the unrealised promise”.</p>
<p>Last year’s film Loving Vincent, told his story in the world’s first animated feature to be entirely hand-painted in oils, an extraordinary labour of love worthy of the man himself.</p>

			<p>			
<p>A STRAIGHT TRACK through a wood, and a guard hut at the end of it, is all there is to “China City of America”.  //为什么是is? a, and b, is ...[病句]</p>

<p>Canada had a similar scheme, but scrapped it in 2014 after it became heavily oversubscribed by wealthy Chinese. //scrap 废弃</p>

<p>长难句： The American one has come under growing scrutiny since it emerged that Nicole Meyer, the sister of President Donald Trump’s influential son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had touted her connections with the Trump family when trying to attract investors to an EB-5 project during a trip to China last May.</p>

<p>In 2017 more than 46% of Chinese with fortunes between 10m and 200m yuan ($1.3m-26.3m) were thinking of emigrating, according to a survey by Hurun, the research company in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The insecurity of wealthy Chinese, and their craving for Western education for their children, is evident in the rapid growth of whole communities of them in the suburbs of big Australian, American and Canadian cities. // a, and b, is ...主谓一致?[病句]</p>

<p>Such places also point to a contradiction in the story of China’s own development. Despite more opportunities at home, growing numbers of those who can afford it seem to want to leave. Even China’s state-owned media admit this. </p>

<p>The number of Chinese students in Australia increased by 17% last year, to 140,000. Apart from the quality of the education, and less fierce competition for places than at China’s best universities, there is another powerful draw: the relative ease with which foreigners who have graduated in Australia can become resident there.// with which是什么从句？with可以替换为其他介词吗？</p>

<p>In Sydney, Monika Tu, the founder of Black Diamondz Property Concierge, specialises in selling expensive houses to rich Chinese. She says she sees little impact from China’s recent clampdown on the movement of capital abroad, or from the government’s efforts to stop corrupt officials from fleeing the country with their wealth. Growing numbers of her clients are young Chinese who have made their fortunes in the country’s booming tech industries.</p>


<p>Many poorer Chinese, too, are attracted by life abroad. The country’s economy may be booming, but for people from rural China, settling and prospering in a big Chinese city can often be as hard as going to work in a foreign country, sometimes even harder. <br />Internal migrants in China are often treated as second-class citizens. Too tough in Ningbo? Try Namibia.</p>
