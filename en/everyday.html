		<h2>How to Improve Spoken English</h2>
		<p>(Without a Speaking Partner!):14 Incredible Methods</p>
		<p>Don’t worry. You can still improve your spoken English, even without a speaking partner.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li><b>Think in English: </b>Try to use English when you’re thinking about your day, or when you’re trying to decide what food to order. </li>
			<li><b>Talk to Yourself: </b>Practice is practice, and even if you don’t have anyone to correct your mistakes, just the act of speaking out loud will help you become more comfortable speaking English.</li>
			<li><b>Use a Mirror: </b>Choose a topic, set a timer for two or three minutes and just talk.</li>
			<li><b>Focus on English Fluency, Not Grammar: </b>Try the mirror exercise above, but challenge yourself to speak without stopping or stammering (taking pauses between your words) the entire time.</li>
			<li><b>Try English Tongue Twisters: </b>Word games like this will help you find the right placement for your mouth and tongue, and can even help your pronunciation.</li>
			<li><b>Listen and Repeat: </b>Choose a short part of a show and repeat it line by line. Try to match the tone, speed and even the accent (if you can). It doesn’t matter if you miss a few words, the important thing is to keep talking. Try to sound just like the native speakers on the show.</li>
			<li><b>Pay Attention to Stressed Sounds: </b>Listen to where native speakers place the emphasis when they speak. Try to repeat it the same way to improve English stress in your own speech.</li>
			<li><b>Sing Along to English Songs: </b>Singing along to your favorite English songs will help you become more fluent. This is a tried-and-true language learning method that’s backed by science.</li>
			<li><b>Learn Word Forms with New Words: </b>Make speaking easier by learning the different forms of any words you learn. You should do this when you’re learning new vocabulary.</li>
			<li><b>Learn Phrases, Not Words: </b>For example, you can say “how do you feel today?” but a native speaker might say “how’re you doing?” or “what’s up?” instead. Phrases and expressions can be helpful for sounding more natural when you speak.</li>
			<li><b>Learn Your Most Common Sayings: </b>Take some time to really notice how you speak in your native language.</li>
			<li><b>Prepare for Specific Situations: </b>If you’re preparing to go to a restaurant, what might conversations in a restaurant sound like? Answer the questions a waiter might ask you. Try talking about food and menus.
You’ll feel more confident if you’re prepared!</li>
			<li><b>Relax!: </b>If you get stuck or confused, just take a big breath and start over. Speak slower if you have to. Take time to pause and think about your next sentence.</li>
			<li><b>Tell a Story from Your Language in English: </b>Remember to think in English as you’re telling your story. Focus on speaking fluently instead of correctly. Say every sentence out loud to yourself.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Even if you have nobody to talk to in English, you can still build confidence and master fluency on your own time.</p>
